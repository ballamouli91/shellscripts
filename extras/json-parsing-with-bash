jq --arg ssid abc --arg pass 123 '.connections[$ssid] = $pass' < file.json
{
  "connections": {
    "abc": "123"
  }
}
Here [$ssid] indexes into .connections with the value of $ssid as the key. The error was at ".$", which is a syntax error, rather than to do with multiple variables.
Variables aren't substituted in directly as strings in the way they might be in a shell script, but are actual named lexical bindings that have to be used in expression context. The index could be a more complex expression: .connections[$ssid + "X"] = $pass would put an X on the end first and use that as the key.
