Write a program to reverse a string “abcdef” --> “fedcba” (preferably NOT using inbuilt functions that come along with the libraries
#! /bin/bash
	string="$1" 
	# you can use  read -p "Enter string:" string
	reverse_string=""
	string_length="${#string}"
	while (( "$string_length">=1 )) 
	do
	# ${string:position:length}” extract single single character from string.
  	   string_length=$(( $string_length -1))
   	  reverse_string="$reverse_string${string:$string_length:1}"
	done
	echo "$reverse_string"
